What is The People’s Coin? 
The People’s Coin (PEEPS) is a community-driven coin, built by people within that very same community. It will host an ever-adapting ecosystem built with the visibility and security of the ETH network. The transparency of the project paired with a welcoming community, from the newest blockchain enthusiast to an abundance of most experienced veterans of the ‘Crypto’ world, will both promote and provide a much-needed source of camaraderie within the current ‘Crypto’ landscape.

Proof of Concept: 
To establish proof of concept in our belief that the power of providing a forum to promote camaraderie within the ‘Crypto world’, we began a grass-roots initiative to provide education, support, and security to individuals of all backgrounds, sharing similar ideals. This led to a fast-growing group of People that led to an organically built community, which collectively recognized the need to provide a forum, allowing everyone to look out for one another within the ‘Crypto landscape’ through education, continual support, and security from ‘bad-actors’ that lurk within the space; prompting the unanimous decision to launch a project that would take this great idea and turn it into a reality… and The People’s Coin was born.

Successful Pre-Sale & Launch:
Similar to our grass-roots realization, from the moment of the original idea,  to the official start to The People’s Coin project, we recognized that the best way to start any successful initiative was to do it organically; ensuring a strong foundation that will provide sustainability and longevity. We realized that the best and fairest way of achieving this would be to hold a pre-sale prior to launching to the public, to protect the integrity of the project’s mission statement of providing an all-inclusive forum to promote and provide camaraderie for ALL.

For the pre-sale, we intentionally capped each individual contribution to 1 ETH to prevent whale wallets from day one. We were pleasantly surprised with the overwhelming response we received, with nearly 2,000 individuals chomping at the bit, not just to fund the project, but actively promote and contribute their time and energy for the greater good. The results: The People’s Coin completed one of the most successful ‘capped’ pre-sales in memory with nearly 1,000 ETH contributed within the 36 hour pre-sale period.

Ahead of ‘The Pack’:
Because of the incredible success of the pre-sale, the project was able to apply nearly $2M directly into the liquidity pool, which meant at launch, unlike other coins with much smaller liquidity pools, the project was successful in preventing front-running bots, while also preventing the first handful of early investors from becoming instant whales, which is a huge step in ensuring early momentum that can turn into sustained growth over time.
It also helps having a sincere project/community name not associated with the lackluster fad of dog meme coins…! ;)

Charitable Giving Initiative: 
Because this project was built from within the community, we also want to give back to the community. As part of our mission, we will frequently be donating to charitable organizations chosen through frequent polls held on our official social media channels, effectively allowing The People to decide where the donations should go. We’ve structured the ability within the project’s contract code to pull from the redistribution funds of the project’s Charitable Giving/Marketing Wallet, which will ensure the utilized funds won’t negatively affect the value of The People’s Coin.


Understanding Our Project Slogan & Our Nickname/Ticker symbol ‘PEEPS’:
Like many other aspects of this project, we want to give the ability for every individual to feel that, as long as they respect the principles of the project, their opinion and vote matters, regardless of whatever their background or beliefs may be. Sometimes in life it’s best to act serious and be formal. While, other times it’s necessary to let loose and have fun. The People’s Coin project recognizes the need to be balanced with both! 

That’s why we’re proud of our slogan, “For the People, by the People”, because we believe it directly and boldy gets our project message across respectfully. 
But we’re just as excited to highlight our project nickname for one another in the community, PEEPS! Which is why it was a no brainer to make our project nickname our ticker symbol as well!

Why should I invest in The People's Coin? 
If you agree with the PEEPS founding premise that the incredible blockchain technology that created the ‘Crypto universe’ could, and should, be used to champion the ability to connect the many individuals within the space with one another to form a protective and inclusive community, then you are also a believer that the PEEPS project can, and will, be that champion. 

Tokenomics:
The PEEPS token supply has a CAPPED amount of 1 Quadrillion tokens i.e. there is a pre-set supply of tokens, that can’t ever increase, preventing dilution that otherwise could instantly decrease the token’s value.
To incentivize HODLing, The People’s Coin team decided to burn nearly 50% of the circulating supply, making the token more scarce, providing further value from the start.
The project’s contract also has a deflationary 2% burn on all transactions, effectively making the token more valuable over time.
Additionally, all PEEPS wallets include a redistribution feature that disperses 2% of all transactions, increasing the value of your coins by simply HODLing with your fellow PEEPS!
To ensure fair disbursement of token supply amongst the entire community, only a modest 6% of the total token supply has been allocated for the Project Development and Charitable Giving/Marketing wallet (3% to the DEV wallet and 3% to the marketing/Charitable giving wallet). This small, but fair percentage should instill confidence in the community that there is proper funding to sustain growth and longevity for the project, which directly correlates with the continued success of the project. Not to mention, just like in every other aspect of this project, we believe in transparency for the great good of our fast-growing community, which is why we’ve publicly named both our ‘Team Wallets’:

Security Measures & Environment Friendly Sustainability:

The People’s Coin team has always recognized the importance of protecting the environment, which is why it has specifically chosen the ETH network to accommodate the PEEPS ecosystem. Not only does this specific blockchain ledger grant all PEEPS holders control of their valuable digital assets with both visibility and security, it is also eco-friendly by utilizing Proof-of-Stake technology to verify every transaction, instead of the energy draining mining process that is currently deployed by other networks, such as Bitcoin. By choosing this method, the PEEPS community can confidently know that it operates in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.
